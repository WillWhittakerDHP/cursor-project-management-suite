Function boundary governance:
- Keep branch-heavy or deeply nested logic out of UI-facing composables
- Split orchestration/state/mutation responsibilities when complexity thresholds are crossed
- Avoid long branchy functions; isolate transformations into named utilities
- Require explicit return types for exported boundary functions
- No silent fallback or error swallowing patterns

See: .project-manager/COMPOSABLE_AUTHORING_PLAYBOOK.md and .project-manager/FUNCTION_AUTHORING_PLAYBOOK.md for thresholds and audit mapping.

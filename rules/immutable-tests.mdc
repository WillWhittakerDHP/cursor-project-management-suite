TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Test files are excluded from linting/type-checking until Phase 3.0 of BETA_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md. Re-enable alwaysApply: true when that phase begins.

Test files are immutable once they pass, lint, and function correctly. Only modify tests when the feature changes, the test has a bug, or refactoring requires updates. Never modify tests to make failing code pass - fix the code instead.

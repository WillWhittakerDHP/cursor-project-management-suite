Follow the session guide structure for all coding sessions. Before starting: label the session (format: `## Session: [Phase].[Sub-Phase] - [Brief Description]`), review previous session notes, set learning goals, identify files to work with. During session: work on one sub-session at a time, pause between sub-sessions for learning checkpoints, document decisions inline. After each sub-session: verify checkpoint (tests pass, types compile), review learning, update progress. End of session checklist (required): 1) Verify app starts - run appropriate start command (e.g., `npm run start:dev:vue` or `npm run start:dev`) to confirm application launches without errors, 2) Run linting - execute linting commands (`cd client-vue && npm run lint` for Vue, `cd client && npm run lint` for React, `cd server && npm run lint` for server) and fix any errors, 3) Update session log - add entry to session log document (e.g., `VUE_MIGRATION_SESSION_LOG.md`) with sub-session details, framework differences, learning checkpoints, questions answered, next sub-session, session status, 4) Update handoff document - update handoff document (e.g., `VUE_MIGRATION_HANDOFF.md`) with phase status updates, sub-session section (Goal, Source/Target Files, Key Features, Important Notes, Architecture Notes, Completion Summary), update "Next Action" and "Last Updated" timestamp, 5) PROMPT USER FOR COMMIT AND PUSH - After all checks pass and docs are updated, prompt the user: "All session-end checks completed successfully: ✅ App starts, ✅ Linting passed, ✅ Build successful, ✅ Session log updated, ✅ Handoff document updated, ✅ Session guide updated. Ready to commit and push all changes? This will commit all changes with session summary message and push to remote repository. Proceed with commit and push? (yes/no)" - If user says "yes", execute git commit and push, then end session. If user says "no", end session without committing (user can commit manually later), 6) Agent hand-off check - determine if continuing with same agent or switching, create compact prompt in format: `@[HANDOFF_DOCUMENT] Continue [project] - start Sub-Session [X.Y.Z] ([Description])`. See: VUE_MIGRATION_SESSION_GUIDE.md, VUE_MIGRATION_SESSION_LOG.md, VUE_MIGRATION_HANDOFF.md. Applies to all coding sessions, especially multi-session projects. Exception: Quick fixes or single-file changes may skip full session structure but should still verify app starts and linting passes.

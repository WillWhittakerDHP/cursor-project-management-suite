Vue reactivity boundary contracts:
- Consumer reads only -> return `ComputedRef<T>`
- Consumer reads + writes -> return `Ref<T>`
- From useQuery/useMutation -> return `ComputedRef<T>`
- Never return `Ref<T> | ComputedRef<T>` at boundaries
- Use typed `InjectionKey<ContextType>`, never untyped `Symbol()`
- API responses: `T | null`; optional props: `T | undefined`; explicit empty: `T | null`
- Avoid mixing null and undefined for the same boundary semantic

See: .project-manager/TYPE_AUTHORING_PLAYBOOK.md for full table and examples.

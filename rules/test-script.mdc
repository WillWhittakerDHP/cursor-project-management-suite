TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Test files are excluded from linting/type-checking until Phase 3.0 of BETA_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md. Re-enable alwaysApply: true when that phase begins.

Tests run in watch mode during development using npm run start:dev:testing. Use standard start:dev for development without test watching.

Vue-only development:
- All new features and changes should be implemented in the Vue frontend codebase (`frontend root directory`)
- The React codebase has been removed (archived in `react-codebase-archive-2025-11-26`)
- For historical reference, the React codebase can be restored from the archive tag if needed
- All development work should focus exclusively on the Vue application

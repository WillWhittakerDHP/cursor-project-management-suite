TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Test files are excluded from linting/type-checking until Phase 3.0 of BETA_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md. Re-enable alwaysApply: true when that phase begins.

Use fine-grained unit tests for pure functions, utilities, and business logic. Use integration tests for context coordination, component integration, and user workflows. See: frontend-root/src/booking/__tests__/utils/feeCalculation.test.ts (unit) and frontend-root/src/admin/tests/integration/contextIntegration.test.tsx (integration).

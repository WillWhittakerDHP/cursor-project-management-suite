Build responsiveness into Vue.js components from the start using mobile-first approach and Vuetify responsive utilities. Use Vuetify's responsive props (cols, sm, md, lg, xl) instead of fixed widths or custom CSS media queries. Each component should handle its own responsiveness at the component level, not as a retrofit. Ensure touch-friendly sizing: minimum 44x44px touch targets, adequate spacing between interactive elements, minimum 16px text size. Use Vuetify's grid system (VContainer, VRow, VCol) with responsive breakpoints. For Ionic Vue compatibility: use standard Vue 3 Composition API patterns, avoid direct browser API access (window, document) - use Vuetify composables like useDisplay() instead, build modular reusable components, design for touch interactions from the start. See: https://vuetifyjs.com/en/features/display-and-platform/, https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/grids/. Applies to all Vue.js UI components and layouts. Exception: Utility functions and pure business logic don't need responsive design but should still avoid browser-specific APIs.

Process and workflow:

**Slash commands (AGENT EXECUTION DIRECTIVE):** When the user invokes a slash command (any file under `.cursor/commands/`), you are receiving an EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW. You MUST: (1) EXECUTE each step sequentially — read files, run shell commands, write documents, git operations — as specified. (2) DO NOT summarize the command or describe what it "would do"; the function body IS your instruction set. (3) For start/end commands, follow `.cursor/commands/tiers/START_END_PLAYBOOK_STRUCTURE.md` and the command-to-entry-point table; resolve the command name to the composite module (feature.ts, phase.ts, session.ts, task.ts under tiers/<tier>/composite/), invoke the exported function with params gathered from context and prompts, use result.outcome.nextAction. Do not run the command file from the shell as the primary workflow. (4) Present any prompts specified and wait for user response; format output per any referenced response template. Failure mode to avoid: responding with "This command would do X" — that is summarization, not execution.

**Session structure:** Label session (## Session: [Phase].[Sub-Phase] - [Brief Description]); review previous notes; set learning goals; work one sub-session at a time with checkpoints. End-of-session checklist: (1) Verify app starts (e.g. npm run start:dev), (2) Run linting (e.g. cd client && npm run lint for Vue, cd server && npm run lint for server) and fix errors, (3) Update session log, (4) Update handoff document (Next Action, Last Updated), (5) Prompt user for commit and push when checks pass, (6) Agent hand-off: compact prompt @[HANDOFF_DOCUMENT] Continue [project] - start Sub-Session X.Y.Z (Description). See: VUE_MIGRATION_SESSION_GUIDE.md, VUE_MIGRATION_HANDOFF.md. Test verification suspended until Phase 3.0 of LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md. Exception: Quick fixes may skip full structure but still verify app starts and linting passes.

**Vue-only development:** All new features and changes in the Vue frontend (frontend root directory). React codebase removed (archived in react-codebase-archive-2025-11-26). All development focuses exclusively on the Vue application.

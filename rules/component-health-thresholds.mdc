Component health thresholds:
- Prop count ≤8, emit count ≤8, coupling ≤5; template directive depth ≤3; template size ≤200 lines (or extract)
- Component-logic Tier1 hotspots (watch, async/await, map/reduce, DOM) warrant extraction to composable or util unless allowlisted

See: .project-manager/COMPONENT_AUTHORING_PLAYBOOK.md for thresholds and allowlist location (audit-global-config).

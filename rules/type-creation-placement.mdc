Type creation and placement:
1. Check `type-constant-inventory-audit.md` before creating a new type
2. Shared type -> `client/src/types/<domain>/`
3. Composable contract -> co-locate by domain in `client/src/types/<domain>/`
4. Single-file-only type -> inline in `<script setup>`
5. Prefer descriptive generic names and type guards over assertion workarounds

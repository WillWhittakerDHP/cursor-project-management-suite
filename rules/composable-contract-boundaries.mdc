Composable contract boundaries:
- Exported composables require explicit return types
- Public composable contracts should be flat for unit testing
- Mutation exposed via explicit actions (setX/updateX/toggleX), not writable leakage
- Read-only boundaries use `ComputedRef<T>`
- Mutable internal state uses `Ref<T>`
- `WritableComputedRef<T>` only for intentional getter+setter semantics
- Never expose `Ref<T> | ComputedRef<T>` unions at public boundaries
- Use typed `InjectionKey<ContextType>`, not untyped string/symbol boundaries

See: .project-manager/COMPOSABLE_AUTHORING_PLAYBOOK.md for full table and examples.

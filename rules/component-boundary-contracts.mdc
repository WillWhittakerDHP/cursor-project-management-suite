Component boundary contracts:
- Components stay thin: template + minimal script; heavy logic in composables or named utilities
- Prop API: prefer bounded count (e.g. ≤8) or grouped config object; avoid prop explosion
- Emit surface: bounded event count or grouped payloads; avoid emit relay chains where provide/inject or composable is clearer
- Slots: shallow slot usage where possible; avoid deep slot wrappers without reason
- Template: avoid deep v-if/v-for nesting; extract sub-components or computed for complex expressions
- Check component-logic and component-health reports before adding allowlist entries; prefer extraction over allowlisting

See: .project-manager/COMPONENT_AUTHORING_PLAYBOOK.md for decision tree, thresholds, and extract vs allowlist.

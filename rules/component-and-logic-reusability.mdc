Identify reusable patterns before duplicating code. When similar code structures appear 2+ times, create generic/reusable components or utilities. Build reusable solutions after identifying patterns, not before. Pattern identification process: 1) Recognize repetition (similar code 2+ times), 2) Identify common structure, 3) Create generic solution, 4) Refactor existing code to use generic solution. Create generic component when: similar code appears 2+ times with same structure, pattern is clear and well-understood, multiple use cases share common logic, pattern is stable. Don't create generic component when: only one use case exists (premature abstraction), pattern is unclear or still evolving, use cases are too different to generalize. Examples: Generic field components (FieldRenderer, BaseField), generic transformers (AdminTransformer, GlobalTransformer), generic instance components (GenericInstance, GenericCollection). See: client/src/admin/components/generic/ for examples. Applies to all code duplication scenarios and component creation. Exception: Don't create generic solutions prematurely - wait until pattern is clear from multiple implementations.

Coding standards:

**Mutability and data flow:** Use functional approaches (map, reduce, filter) over mutations. Avoid forEach for transformations; use map. Use for...of only for early returns or side effects. Avoid mutating arrays/objects in loops. Create clear, typed, well-documented transformation functions instead of complex nested transformations or prop-drilling. See: frontend-root/src/admin/dataTransformation/bridgeToAdminTransformer.ts

**Return types and errors:** Include explicit return types in function definitions to avoid type casting. Handle errors with explicit logging; no silent fallbacks or filters that hide errors; log and propagate appropriately.

**Types:** Avoid unnecessary type assertions (as any, as unknown as). Prefer type guards (value is Type) over assertions. Use keyof/typeof only when necessary for constraints. See: frontend-root/src/admin/dataTransformation/typeAdapters.ts. Maintain generic patterns with runtime configs over specific type definitions (e.g. EntityBase<GlobalEntityKey> with ENTITY_CONFIGS). See: frontend-root/src/global/types/globalEntityTypes.ts, server/src/config/entityRegistry.ts. Use descriptive generic names (GlobalEntityKey not K, GlobalPropertyKey not P).

**Refactors:** During refactors, do not introduce unnecessary fallbacks, filtering, new types, or new properties unless directed; use current property names and types.

**Performance:** Memoize components and computed values when they receive object/array props that change reference frequently or perform expensive computations. Use Vue computed() and v-memo strategically; optimize only when profiling shows issues.

**Responsive design:** Mobile-first; Vuetify responsive props (cols, sm, md, lg, xl) and grid (VContainer, VRow, VCol). Touch-friendly: min 44x44px targets, 16px text. Avoid direct window/document; use Vuetify composables like useDisplay(). See: Vuetify display and grids docs.

**Documentation:** Before new components or similar functionality, check existing generic/reusable components (frontend admin generic directory), transformer patterns, and codebase implementations. Check SCHEDULER_COMPONENT_SPECS.md, VUE_MIGRATION_HANDOFF.md, READMEs, migration guides.

Check existing documentation, patterns, and reusable components before implementing similar functionality. Before creating new components: check for existing generic/reusable components (see: client/src/admin/components/generic/). Before creating transformers: review existing transformer patterns (see: client/src/admin/dataTransformation/, client-vue/src/api/transformers/). Before implementing similar functionality: search codebase for existing implementations. Before duplicating code patterns: identify if generic solution exists. Check architecture documentation (SCHEDULER_COMPONENT_SPECS.md, VUE_MIGRATION_HANDOFF.md), component documentation (README files), and migration guides. Applies to all new implementations and component creation.
